# State and Locking

Terraform has two critical processes:

* ðŸ“· State
* ðŸ”’ Locking

All of this must be configured prior to using Terraform. You can run this deployment via:

```console
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## ðŸ“· State

State is stored in AWS S3 and it includes everything that Terraform is
managing. By storing state in shared location, we avoid a situation where
multiple state stores clash and do not contain the same information.

## ðŸ”’ Locking

Locks ensure that two instances of terraform cannot take action on deployments
at the same time. This prevents race conditions where conflicting changes are
applied.

locking capabilities and requirements:
