## What is the goal of this repository?

Complex cloud deployments involve plenty of interlocking parts that must be
managed over time. We can specify exactly how our cloud deployment should look
using Terraform and it does the heavy lifting for us.

We also gain the benefit of being able to tear down and rebuild the entire
deployment in minutes. Migrating to another region involves making a pull
request with some changes and merging those changes.
