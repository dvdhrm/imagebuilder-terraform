## Keeping resources organized

Terraform resources can sprawl a bit as the deployments get more complex. It's
a good idea to organize the resources based on the things that go together.
The current resource files include:

* `data.tf`: data to gather from AWS resources that already exist
* `output.tf`: data to print after a `terraform apply` run
* `provider.tf`: deployment-wide configurations for AWS
* `terraform.tf`: deployment-wide general configuration

## ðŸ”’ State and locks

Terraform uses centralized state and locks to ensure consistency in
deployments. Review the [README](state-and-locks/README.md) and terraform
resources in the `state-and-locks` directory.
